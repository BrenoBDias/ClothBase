Understand the requirements: Before starting the design process, it is important to understand
the requirements and constraints of the system. This includes gathering information about the problem space,
performance requirements, scalability needs, and security concerns.

##Requirements: it is required that the program runs in any personal computer with 4 or more cores.


Identify the major components: Identify the major components of the system and how they interact with each other.
This includes determining the relationships between different components and how they contribute to the overall functionality
of the system.

##Major components: GUI and backend will run in the same program (?) by enabling multithreading, while Database will handle
information storage. Information will be saved in database after every product registration

Choose appropriate technology: Based on the requirements and components, choose the appropriate technology
to implement the system. This may involve choosing hardware and software platforms, databases, programming languages, and tools.

##Technology: The system will be run with a python backend handling requests and data input, while the database will use mySQL.

Define the interface: Define the interface between different components of the system, including APIs, protocols, and data formats.

Design the data model: Design the data model for the system, including the schema for the database, 
the structure of data files, and the data flow between components.

**Data Model:**
   - **Materials Table:**
     - Attributes:
       - ID: Unique identifier for the material.
       - Name: Name of the material.
       - Image: File path or reference to the locally stored image of the material.
       - Category ID: Identifier linking the material to its category.
       - Source: Source or supplier of the material.
       - Quantity: Quantity of the material available.
       - Price per unity: Price payed per unity of the material when it was acquired.
       - Added Timestamp: Timestamp indicating when the material was added to the database.
   - **Categories Table:**
     - Attributes:
       - ID: Unique identifier for the category.
       - Name: Name of the category.

Consider scalability and performance: ??????????

Test and validate the design: ????????

Deploy and maintain the system: Finally, deploy the system and maintain it over time, including fixing bugs,
updating components, and adding new features as needed.
